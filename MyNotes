Listing 1-2 Example of using the shift command
The script (it is a kind of templeta ,but still it should be clear) as it is written in the book,
does not provide a mechanism to exit the while-loop. And the point at which the addition happens is 
not good. Here is how it should be :
  #!/usr/bin/sh
  # Mastering Unix Shell scripting 2008, Chapter1 page 16
  # Listing 1-2 Example of using the shift command
  TOTAL=0		# Initialize the TOTAL counter to zero
  # Start a while loop
  while true
  do
  	TOKEN=$1
  	[ -z $TOKEN ] && break;
  	TOTAL=`expr $TOTAL + 1`  #or TOTAL=$(($TOTAL + 1))
  	echo "Argument processed : $TOKEN " #
  	shift		# Grab the next token, i.e. $2 becomes $1
  done
  echo "Total number of tokens processed: $TOTAL"
